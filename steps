    - BETTING:
        - can only bet up to the amount a player has
        - if all players in a hand all "all in". All players show cards and each round is played without additional betting
        - if player doesn't have enough money to match a bet but they want to play
            - side pot gets created between players for any amount over the amount that player can bet
                - Example:
                    - 4 players - 3 have $100 but one only has $30
                        - player1 bets $50
                        - player2 matches $50
                        - player3 folds
                        - player4 goes all in with $30 (doesn't have $50 to bet)
                            - player1's bet is split into $30 to main pot, $20 to side pot with player2
                            - player2's bet is split into $30 to main pot, $20 to side pot with player1
                            - player4's bet is only $30 into main pot
                                - player1 and player2 can continue betting but will only bet into side pot with each other. No other money can be added to main pot
                                - player4 can only win money from main pot
                                    - if player4 has best overall hand, they will only win main pot
                                        - side pot will be won by either player1 or player2, even if player4 had best hand


    Game:
    one player is big blind, one is small blind (initial bets)
        - if only 2 players, it rotates back and forth
        - if more than 2, it rotates in a standard rotation (through an array)

    each player dealt 2 cards face down (one per player per rotation)
        - everyone bets
            - can either match big blind, raise, or fold
                - if only matched big blind, big blind can check - not bet but move on
                - if raised from big blind, all players must match or fold
                    - if fold, they are done for that hand

    one card burned, three table cards flipped over
        - everyone bets
            - can either check, or bet
                - if anyone bets, everyone must either match or raise
                    - if anyone raises, others must match or fold

    one card burned, one card flipped over
        - betting occurs again

    finally, one card burned, one card flipped over
        - final round of betting
        - all players now compare cards to see who won
            - winner takes all money and new hand is started with the big and little blinds moving on in the rotation

    If player runs out of money, they are done.

    - Keep playing until only one winner


    FUTURE UPDATE:
        - add support for 1-6 human players on different terminals
            - will need a client/server setup
